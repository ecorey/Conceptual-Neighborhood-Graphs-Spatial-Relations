Using a 2x2 scene description it is possible to derive similarity using the base
relationsâ€™ conceptual neighborhood graph.

These are the three conceptual neighborhood graphs for simple region-region relations.

The similarity between each of the pair of raster region relations can be determined for each one of the three conceptual neighborhood graphs as seen here.

These Conceptual neighboorhood graphs for the 29 relations between two raster regions were constructed using the three sets of similarity values as shown above.

Using the atttach Python code the CNGs are output as follows:
